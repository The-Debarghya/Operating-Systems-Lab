What were They eating? It didn't taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished, she didn't dare ask. She knew The answer would be one she didn't want to hear.
Devon couldn't figure out The color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that They were green, but The more he looked at Them he almost wanted to say They were a golden yellow. Then There were The flashes of red and orange that seemed to be streaked throughout Them. It was almost as if her eyes were made of opal with The sun constantly glinting off of Them and bringing out more color.
They were definitely The most unusual pair of eyes he'd ever seen.I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. The document noon I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in anoTher program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on
anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for The distraction."It was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing," he said.
"This is going to sound funny and a little strange, but you were in a dream I had just a couple of days ago. I'd love to get togeTher and tell you about it if you're up for a cup of coffee," he continued, laying The trap he'd been planning for years.

Why do Americans have madam so many different types of towels? We have beach towels, hand towels, bath towels, dish towels, camping towels, quick-dry towels, and let’s not forget paper towels. Would 1 type of towel work for each of These things? Let’s take a beach towel. It can be used to dry your hands and body with no difficulty. A beach towel could be used to dry dishes. Just think how many dishes you could dry with one beach towel.
I’ve used a beach towel with no adverse effects while camping. If you buy a thin beach towel it can dry quickly too.

Is having so many types of towels an extravagant luxury that Americans enjoy or is it necessary? I’d say it's overkill and we could cut down on The many types of towels that manufacturers deem necessary.
